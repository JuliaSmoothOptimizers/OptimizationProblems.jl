#   The clamped plate problem (Strang, Nocedal, Dax)
#   The problem comes from the discretization the following problem
#   in mechanics:  a plate is clamped on one edge and loaded on the
#   opposite side.  The plate is the unit square.
#
#   The plate is clamped on its lower edge, by fixing the
#   corresponding variables to zero.
#
#   In this version of the problem, the weight wght is distributed
#   equally along the upper edge, introducing a symmetry with respect
#   to the vertical axis.

#   classification OXR2-MN-V-0
#
#   p is the number of points in one side of the unit square
#   The number of variables is p*p, of which (p-1)*(p-1) are free.
#
#   Fixed variables have been eliminated from the objective function.
