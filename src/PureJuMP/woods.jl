#   The extended Woods problem.

#   This problem is a sum of n/4 sets of 6 terms, each of which is
#   assigned its own group.  For a given set i, the groups are
#   A(i), B(i), C(i), D(i), E(i) and F(i). Groups A(i) and C(i) contain 1
#   nonlinear element each, denoted Y(i) and Z(i).

#   The problem dimension is defined from the number of these sets.
#   The number of problem variables is then 4 times larger.

#   This version uses a slightly unorthodox expression of Woods
#   function as a sum of squares (see Buckley)
