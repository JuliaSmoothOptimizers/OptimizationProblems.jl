In that case, the first keyword parameter should be the number of variables n::Int and have the default value default_nvar (constant predefined in the module). If your problem has restrictions on the number of variables, e.g., n should be odd, or n should have the form 4k + 3, then, instead of throwing errors when the restrictions are not satisfied, you should instead use the number of variables to be as close to n as possible. For example, if you want n odd and n = 100 is passed, you can internally convert to n = 99. If you want n = 4k + 3, and n = 100 is passed, then compute k = round(Int, (n - 3) / 4) and update n.\nA first version of the meta can be generated using generate_meta. A String is returned that can be copy-pasted into the Meta folder, and then edited.","category":"page"},{"location":"contributing/","page":"Contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"    using ADNLPModels, NLPModels, NLPModelsJuMP, OptimizationProblems\n    include(\"test/utils.jl\")\n    # there must exists a function `problem_name` which loads the model in the environment\n    name = \"problem_name\"\n    open(\"$name.jl\", \"w\") do io\n      print(io, generate_meta(name))\n    end","category":"page"},{"location":"contributing/","page":"Contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"Problems modeled with ADNLPModels should be type-stable, i.e. they should all have keyword argument type::Val{T} = Val(Float64) where T is the type of the initial guess and the type used by the NLPModel API.","category":"page"},{"location":"contributing/#Templates-for-the-new-functions","page":"Contributing","title":"Templates for the new functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"contributing/","page":"Contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"In order to standardize the new functions, we offer here a template for both AD and JuMP models.","category":"page"},{"location":"contributing/","page":"Contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"First, we describe the PureJuMP file function_name.jl.
